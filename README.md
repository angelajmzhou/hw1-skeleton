The IEEE floating point standard is a rich and complex design, and the best way to really
understand how it represents numbers is to build utilities to manipulate floating point numbers
as raw bits. You will need to write three functions for dealing with floating points numbers:
floating_info, ieee_16_info, and as_ieee_16.
The first two functions are string formatting functions that will convert the input (either a union
type or a 16b value depending on the option) to a formatted string describing the internal
information. For a normal floating point number it it should have a + or - depending on the sign
bit, then the significand in binary in the format of the most significant bit, a decimal point, and
then the remaining 23 (for 32b floats) or 10 (for 16b floats) bits, a space, and then the exponent
as 2^ and then a signed integer. As an example, the floating point number .5 is
represented as "+1.00000000000000000000000 2^-1" (without the quotation marks).
For denormalized numbers you should output them with a leading 0, then all 23 or 10 bits and
with the exponent. 0 should be "+0" or "-0" depending on the sign. An infinity should be
"+INF" or "-INF", and a NAN should be "NaN". These functions should be safe: if the buffer
passed in is insufficiently large it should truncate the output to fit.
The final function, as_iee_16, should take a 32b floating point value (passed as a union type to
make direct manipulations easier) and convert it to 16b IEEE half-precision floating point. There
are several corner cases you need to consider, including subnormals, infinities, NANs (which
remain NANs), and rounding (using ‚Äòrounding towards even‚Äô) when converting a 32b floating
point value to a 16b value.
You will only turn in your floating.c file, and you must not change the header file
floating.h, and you can‚Äôt include any other libraries into floating.c. This assignment is
due on April 24th at 2000 PDT (10:00 pm Davis time). You must work on this assignment
individually.

Expected Homework Outcomes:

1. Really understand the structure and complexity of IEEE Floating Point

Hints
You can (and indeed should) write more tests in main.c. The main function you are provided
just takes the arguments on the command line, use strtof to read them as floating point
numbers, and then pass them through the various functions and print them out. Although useful
for development you would be advised to write further tests, such as ones that take known
hexadecimal values. A useful utility for creating such tests is the h-schmidt.net floating point
converter page at https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html
One particular important set of tests will be various corner cases, best described as ‚Äúmagic
numbers‚Äù. You must not privately share interesting magic numbers you discover with your fellow students.

Instead, you may post them publicly in the ‚ÄúMagic Number‚Äù announcement
thread, either in decimal form (e.g. 3.141592 or -1e-45) or in hexadecimal (e.g. 40490fd8 or
80000001), and include a notion why they are special (in this case, ‚Äúthe closest floating point
approximation to pi, because ü•ß is tasty‚Äù and ‚Äúthe negative number closest to 0 in 32b floating
point‚Äù)
The reason for this policy is that the autograder is going to, like Homework 0, be blind: A basic
sanity test will be public but the rest will be hidden cases. So coming up with tests is important.
And at the same time I want students to collaborate on interesting tests, but I want such
collaboration to be universal: all students should benefit from shared expertise.
So, for example, if your fellow student asks for help and you see a magic number that would
trigger a bug, don‚Äôt tell your fellow student, instead tell everyone.
